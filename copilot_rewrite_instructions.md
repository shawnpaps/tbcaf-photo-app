# Copilot Rewrite Instructions --- sudo.create Website

## Purpose

This guide is for GitHub Copilot to rewrite **all copy and microcopy**
on the sudo.create website to align with the studio's new brand
positioning, tone, and direction.\
The website is built with **Astro** and includes some **React
components**. Copilot should rewrite text content within `.astro`,
`.jsx`, and `.tsx` files while preserving structure and logic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Brand Overview

**sudo.create** is a creative media studio that helps artists, brands,
musicians, events, podcasters, and creators tell stories through
photography, videography, audio, and technology.\
We blend art, media, and tech to create visuals and systems that move
people.

**Core Offerings:** - Visual storytelling (photo & video) - Audio
production & editing - Creative tech & content systems - Strategy &
creative direction

**Mission:** Create art that resonates, systems that empower, and
stories that move people.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Voice and Tone

**Overall Personality:** Confident, cinematic, creative, and human ---
with a bit of cheek when appropriate.\
**Think:** "A creative studio that's visionary, not pretentious."

**Voice Characteristics:** - **Creative:** Uses storytelling, emotion,
and visuals in language.\

fluff.\
- **Cheeky Edge:** A wink of wit and playfulness, especially in
microcopy (buttons, CTAs, captions).\
- **Empowering:** Makes creators feel inspired, capable, and understood.

**Avoid:** Jargon, buzzwords, overused agency-speak ("disruptive,"
"cutting-edge," etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Brand Language Framework

**Tagline Ideas:**\
- "Creativity deserves infrastructure."\
- "Art meets systems."\
- "Built for flow, not friction."\
- "Visuals. Sound. Systems. Flow."

**Tone Adjectives:** cinematic, modern, grounded, intentional, fluid,
inspired.

**Microcopy Examples:**\
- Button: "Let's create." or "Start your flow."\
- Error/Empty state: "Looks like your creativity's buffering."\
- CTA: "Ready to tell your story?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rewrite Objectives

Copilot should ensure all website copy:\
1. Reflects sudo.create's **positioning as a creative media studio**.\
2. Emphasizes **visual storytelling** as the hero service.\
3. References **audio and tech** as supportive strengths.\
4. Sounds **alive, cinematic, and human** --- not robotic or corporate.\
5. Uses **short sentences, rhythm, and visual language**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section-by-Section Prompts

### üè† HERO SECTION

-   **Goal:** Instantly communicate what sudo.create does and who it's
    for.\
-   **Voice:** Bold, confident, cinematic.\
-   **Prompt:**\
    "Rewrite the hero section headline and subtext to capture
    sudo.create's mission: helping artists, brands, and events tell
    stories through visual media, sound, and technology. Keep it under
    15 words. Include a short call to action."\
-   **CTA Ideas:** `Let‚Äôs create`, `Start your flow`, `Book your shoot`,
    `Tell your story`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üôå ABOUT SECTION

-   **Goal:** Tell the story of Paps and the purpose behind
    sudo.create.\
-   **Voice:** Personal, visionary, slightly poetic.\
-   **Prompt:**\
    "Rewrite the About section to highlight Paps as a Creative Director
    who blends art, sound, and systems. Show how sudo.create helps
    creatives turn ideas into experiences. Include a short manifesto
    tone."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üé• SERVICES SECTION

-   **Goal:** Clearly present offers in a cinematic and modular tone.\
-   **Voice:** Professional but vibrant.\
-   **Prompt:**\
    "Rewrite the Services section using these structure and names:

    -   REACTOR --- high-end system and creative tech projects.\
    -   A La Carte --- flexible photography, audio, and tech services."

Use engaging copy for each tier that communicates **impact and vibe**,
not just deliverables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### üí¨ CONTACT / CTA SECTION

-   **Goal:** Encourage collaboration and convey creative partnership.\
-   **Voice:** Warm, inspiring, confident.\
-   **Prompt:**\
    "Rewrite contact page copy to sound inviting, visionary, and direct.
    Replace generic CTAs like 'Contact Us' with human phrasing like
    'Let's build your story,' or 'Start your flow.'"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation Notes

-   Preserve HTML/JSX structure when rewriting.\
-   Avoid modifying classNames, attributes, or Astro directives.\
-   Do not insert placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum").\
-   Keep paragraph and heading hierarchy intact.\
-   Ensure headings use short, action-oriented phrases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final Output Expectations

Copilot should generate: - Rewritten headlines, subtext, and microcopy
consistent with sudo.create's voice.\
- Optional alternates for key phrases when tone allows (e.g., playful or
cinematic).\
- Copy that reads naturally aloud and visually flows with strong rhythm.

**Key Idea:** Every word should sound like it was written by a creative
director who understands both art and systems.
